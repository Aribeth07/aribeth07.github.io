I've had enough.

Those who know me well may realise that this is my fifth child, and it's highly possible she will be the last. She made me proud by her elegant and stoic appearance, almost zero space for censorship. She outshines allÂ her predecessors as if they were adopted from a Kafkaesque colossus which is constantly watching them from above.

I create this child. With detailed tutorials and tool packs piling on the Internet, technical barriers are much easier to break these days. Should you try the same thing, I would suggest to get an oversee Virtual Private Server and google the rest of it - as you may be told or you've already figured out by yourself, you should NOT use any search engines other than google.

If you want to post comments you don't have to give away your phone number, because you are not in CN LAN. Yes, I bring that up because I despise phone number authentication.

If you want to DDos this site for whatever reason hope you have mercy, as it really accomplishes nothing.

Hope you enjoy.
